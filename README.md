shack-py
========

`shack-py` is going to be a back-end to a [selfoss](http://selfoss.aditu.de/) style database (selfosshack). To the best of my knowledge it won't work with vanilla selfoss (there is an unpublished frontend that uses either the selfosshack db or a vanilla selfoss db).

The frontend is pending a rewrite in python as well, but I'm starting with the backend.
